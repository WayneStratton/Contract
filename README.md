**1.0 Services Rendered**

DESIGN

We create look-and-feel designs and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so we won't waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. We may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (color, texture, and typography.) You'll have two or more opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. If at any stage, you're not happy with the direction our work is taking, you will pay us in full for everything we've produced up to that point and this contract will be canceled.

TEXT CONTENT

Writing text copy is not included in this contract. If you'd like us to write new content or input text for you, we're happy to provide a separate estimate for that.

PHOTOGRAPHS

You'll need to supply graphics files to us in an editable, vector digital format. Photographs must be in a high-resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries and style of photography/images. If you'd like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that. Cost of buying stock photographs or a photo shoot is not included in this contract.

HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

We deliver templates developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive Javascript for feature detection, polyfills and behaviors.

WORDPRESS INTEGRATION

We'll set up, install and configure WordPress and/or any related plugins, templates, or scripts on your hosting server as described in the estimate. WordPress is a third-party tool and therefore we can't be responsible for any bugs associated with WordPress or its plugins. If any bugs are found during the development phase or 7 days after launch, we'll fix it (if possible) or update WordPress or the faulty plugin if it's available, but after the 7 days, we'll charge a per-project rate for any changes.

BROWSER TESTING

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

DESKTOP BROWSER TESTING

We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), and Mozilla Firefox. We'll also test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience. We won't test in other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

MOBILE BROWSER TESTING

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they're using. We test our work in iOS: Safari Android 4.1: Google Chrome, Firefox Android 3.2: Browser, Firefox We currently don't test Blackberry OS or Blackberry QNX, Opera Mobile, Symbian or other mobile browsers. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We're not a website hosting company so we don't offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don't, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. After that, any updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

CHANGES AND REVISIONS

We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don't want to limit your ability to change your mind or make decisions later when you might be better informed. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything you've told us you want to achieve, but we're happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be a problem as we'll provide a separate estimate for to cover the additional work.

ERRORS

We can't guarantee that our work will be error-free (we're human!) so we can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of them.

**2.0 Mutual Cooperation**

We agree to use our best efforts to fulfill and exceed your expectation on the deliverables listed above. You agree to aid us in doing so by making available to us needed information pertaining to your website and to cooperate with us in expediting the work.

**3.0 Charges for Services Performed**

Functionality or feature requests above and beyond those listed in the budget and/or the functionality specs may be considered out-of-scope and an amendment to the budget will be recommended. Projects that go dormant for longer than 45 days will incur a $450 restart fee plus an upfront payment of the remaining balance to resume work at the discretion of Wayne Stratton. Any project that remains incomplete 120 days from the start date will be canceled with all payments forfeited to Nuts and Bolts Media.
